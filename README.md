# Proposal 🔥
The idea is to simulate a book finder app, bringing data from Google Books API and integrate the information available on screen, such as the recently read books. The difference of this project is the responsive mode built for all mobile devices, some pages built using Static Site Generation (SSG), the creation of global state of Books and Searches with Context API and the user interface made with Chakra UI.
